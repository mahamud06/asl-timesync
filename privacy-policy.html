    <h1>Privacy Policy for ASL TimeSync Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [05-17-2025]</p>

    <p>ASL TimeSync Extension (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Chrome browser extension designed to help organizations manage workforce time and productivity by capturing screenshots and tracking work activities during employee browser sessions.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Our extension provides tools for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Time and attendance logging</li>
        <li>Break management</li>
        <li>Automated reminders</li>
        <li>Salary estimation</li>
        <li>And workforce monitoring via screenshots</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Collect Screenshots</h2>
    <p>To ensure workplace productivity and compliance, we capture screenshots of the user’s active browser tab periodically. These screenshots help supervisors verify that employees are focused on work-related tasks and not engaging in non-work activities such as social media or video streaming.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Screenshots are <strong>only uploaded to your organization’s designated Google Drive folder</strong>.</li>
        <li>They are used <strong>solely for internal monitoring</strong> and workforce management purposes.</li>
        <li>No screenshots or other data are shared with third parties outside your organization.</li>
        <li>Your Google account credentials are never stored or accessed beyond what is needed for Google Drive authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security and Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to screenshots is strictly limited to authorized personnel within your organization.</li>
        <li>Data transmission uses secure, encrypted connections.</li>
        <li>You can revoke the extension’s Google Drive access anytime via your Google account permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function properly, the extension requires permissions to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access active browser tabs to capture screenshots (<code>tabs</code> permission).</li>
        <li>Authenticate your Google account for Drive uploads (<code>identity</code> permission).</li>
        <li>Store your settings locally (<code>storage</code> permission).</li>
        <li>Interact with browser content as needed (<code>scripting</code> and <code>host_permissions</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may disable screenshot capturing by contacting your organization’s administrator.</li>
        <li>You can revoke the extension’s access to your Google account at any time in your Google Account settings.</li>
        <li>For questions about data privacy or security, contact your organization’s data protection officer or administrator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
