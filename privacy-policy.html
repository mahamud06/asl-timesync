 Privacy Policy for ASL TimeSync Extension
Effective Date: [Insert Date]

ASL TimeSync Extension (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Chrome browser extension designed to help organizations manage workforce time and productivity by capturing screenshots and tracking work activities during employee browser sessions.

What We Do
Our extension provides tools for:

Time and attendance logging

Break management

Automated reminders

Salary estimation

And workforce monitoring via screenshots

Why We Collect Screenshots
To ensure workplace productivity and compliance, we capture screenshots of the user’s active browser tab periodically. These screenshots help supervisors verify that employees are focused on work-related tasks and not engaging in non-work activities such as social media or video streaming.

How We Use Your Data
Screenshots are only uploaded to your organization’s designated Google Drive folder.

They are used solely for internal monitoring and workforce management purposes.

No screenshots or other data are shared with third parties outside your organization.

Your Google account credentials are never stored or accessed beyond what is needed for Google Drive authentication.

Data Security and Access
Access to screenshots is strictly limited to authorized personnel within your organization.

Data transmission uses secure, encrypted connections.

You can revoke the extension’s Google Drive access anytime via your Google account permissions.

Permissions
To function properly, the extension requires permissions to:

Access active browser tabs to capture screenshots (tabs permission).

Authenticate your Google account for Drive uploads (identity permission).

Store your settings locally (storage permission).

Interact with browser content as needed (scripting and host_permissions).

User Rights and Controls
You may disable screenshot capturing by contacting your organization’s administrator.

You can revoke the extension’s access to your Google account at any time in your Google Account settings.

For questions about data privacy or security, contact your organization’s data protection officer or administrator.
